# Social Campaign Type

## Overview

Social campaigns focus on community engagement, ecosystem milestones, and human-centered stories about Arc Network participation.

## Valid Caption Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

```
Just deployed my first contract on Arc testnet. The USDC gas thing actually makes sense now - paid exactly what I expected. Small win, but it's the small things 🛠️ #ArcNetwork
```

```
Our Discord just hit 50k members. Not because of promises, but because people are actually curious about what USDC-native gas means for the future. Thanks for being here. #ArcNetwork
```

```
Watched a friend bridge to Arc for the first time. "Wait, the fee is in USDC?" - yep, that reaction never gets old 😂 #ArcNetwork
```

### ❌ Bad Examples (NEVER USE)

```
JOIN NOW FOR GUARANTEED WHITELIST! Arc community is exploding! 🚀🚀🚀
```
*Why bad: False promises, excessive hype*

```
If you're not in the Arc Discord you're NGMI. This is the alpha. Trust me.
```
*Why bad: FOMO tactics, "alpha" claims, insider language*

## Tone Guidelines

```

## Community Guidelines
