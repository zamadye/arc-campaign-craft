# Builder Campaign Type

## Overview

Builder campaigns target developers and technical users, focusing on Arc's development experience, tooling, and technical capabilities.

## Valid Caption Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

```
Deployed the same contract to Arc that I had on Ethereum. Hardhat config change, deploy, done. Full EVM compatibility isn't marketing - it's real. #ArcNetwork #BuildOnArc
```

```
Testing liquidation logic on Arc testnet. Sub-second finality means my liquidation bot actually works in real-time, not "probabilistic real-time." Big difference. #ArcNetwork
```

```
The USDC gas experience as a dev: I can estimate costs accurately for users. No more "gas might spike 10x during deploy." Finally. #BuildOnArc #ArcNetwork
```

### ❌ Bad Examples (NEVER USE)

```
If you're not building on Arc you're going to miss the biggest opportunity ever! Mainnet incoming! 🚀
```
*Why bad: FOMO tactics, unverified mainnet claims*

```
Arc is 100x faster than Ethereum and 1000x cheaper. Facts.
```
*Why bad: Unverified performance claims, misleading comparisons*

## Technical Topics

| Topic | Angle |
|-------|-------|
| EVM Compatibility | Real experience, not marketing claims |
| Tooling | Hardhat, Foundry, Remix all work |
| Gas Model | USDC predictability for dApp UX |
| Finality | What deterministic finality enables |
| Consensus | Malachite's technical properties |

## Required Elements

1. Technical accuracy
2. Genuine dev experience
3. Specific, verifiable claims only
4. No performance numbers without source

## Caption Structure

```
[Technical challenge/discovery] + [How Arc handles it] + [Developer insight] + #ArcNetwork + #BuildOnArc
```
