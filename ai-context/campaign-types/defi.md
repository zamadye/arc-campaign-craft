# DeFi Campaign Type

## Overview

DeFi campaigns promote decentralized finance opportunities on Arc Network, emphasizing the unique benefits of USDC-native gas and fast finality.

## Valid Caption Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

```
Just tried DeFi on @ArcFlowFinance - gas fees in USDC means I actually know what I'm paying. No more ETH volatility surprises 🎯 #ArcNetwork #DeFi
```

```
Sub-second finality changes everything for DeFi. Liquidations on Arc are instant, not "15 blocks later" instant. Real-time risk management. #ArcNetwork
```

```
Providing liquidity on Arc is different. USDC gas = predictable costs. Know exactly what you're earning vs paying. #DeFi #ArcNetwork
```

### ❌ Bad Examples (NEVER USE)

```
🚀 HUGE RETURNS on ArcFlow! 10x your money easy! 💰 #ArcNetwork
```
*Why bad: Makes financial promises, uses "10x", implies guaranteed returns*

```
Confirmed airdrop for Arc testnet users! Get in NOW before it's too late! 
```
*Why bad: Unverified airdrop claim, creates false FOMO*

```
NFA but Arc is going to moon, this is the next 100x 🚀🚀🚀
```
*Why bad: Price speculation, forbidden "NFA" disclaimer, moon/100x language*

## Tone Guidelines

| Aspect | Do | Don't |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Benefits | Focus on UX improvements | Promise financial returns |
| Technology | Explain what's different | Make unverified claims |
| Ecosystem | Mention real partners | Exaggerate partnerships |
| Urgency | Explain genuine value | Create false FOMO |

## Required Elements

1. **Must mention** @ArcFlowFinance or Arc Network
2. **Should include** specific DeFi use case
3. **Can include** comparison to other chains (factually)
4. **Must avoid** financial promises, airdrop mentions

## Caption Structure

```
[Hook - specific benefit] + [How Arc makes it possible] + [Call to action] + #ArcNetwork + [optional 2nd hashtag]
```
